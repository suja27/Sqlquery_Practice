"PROBLEM STATEMENT: In the given input table, some of the invoice are missing, write a sql query to identify the missing serial no. 
As an assumption, consider the serial no with the lowest value to be the first generated invoice and the highest serial no value to be the last generated invoice"				
				
drop table if exists invoice;
create table invoice
(
	serial_no		int,
	invoice_date	date
);
insert into invoice values (330115, ('01-Mar-2024'));
insert into invoice values (330120,('01-Mar-2024'));
insert into invoice values (330121,('01-Mar-2024'));
insert into invoice values (330122,('02-Mar-2024'));
insert into invoice values (330125,('02-Mar-2024'));

Solution 
with  Mincte  as
(select Min(serial_no) Minserial_no from invoice),
Maxcte  as
(select Max(serial_no) Maxserial_no from invoice),
 rcte as
(select Minserial_no as Serial_no from mincte
union all
select  Serial_no+1 as  Serial_no  from rcte 
where  Serial_no < (select Maxserial_no from Maxcte))
select serial_no  as Missing_Serial from rcte
except
select serial_no  as Missing_Serial from invoice
